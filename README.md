# bifurcationEWS

*bifurcationEWS* is an R package accompanying the paper “Early Warning
Signals of Complex Critical Transitions in Deterministic Dynamics” by
Evers et al. (submitted). The package supports timeseries simulation of
many deterministic bifurcations, computation of some univariate and
multivariate Early Warning Signals (EWS), and an assessment of the
performance of EWS. As an example, it uses the four-dimensional
Generalised Lotka Volterra (GLV) model, with strength of
interconnectivity $s$ as the control parameter.

These transitions can also be visualised using a bifurcation diagram:
